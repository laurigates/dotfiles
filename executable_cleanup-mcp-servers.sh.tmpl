# Cleanup MCP servers - removes all MCP servers from user and project scope
#
# NOTE: MCP servers are now managed project-by-project.
# This script is primarily for cleanup of old user-scoped installations.
#
# WARNING: This script will disrupt active Claude sessions!
# Only run this when:
# - You need to clean up old user-scoped MCP servers
# - You need to fix broken MCP configurations
# - No Claude Code sessions are running
#
# After cleanup, use /install-mcp command to reinstall servers per-project.
# Configuration is read from .chezmoidata.toml [mcp_servers] section.
