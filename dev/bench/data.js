          "message": "fix(ci): point setup-homebrew at main, not the deleted master branch (#430)\n\n## What\n\nRepoint `Homebrew/actions/setup-homebrew` from `@master` to `@main` in\n`smoke.yml` (two jobs), `coverage.yml`, `sbom.yml` and `claude.yml`.\n\n## Why\n\nHomebrew/actions renamed its default branch to `main` and deleted\n`master`. Every job pinned to `@master` now fails during action\nresolution, before a single step runs:\n\n```\n##[error]Unable to resolve action `Homebrew/actions@master`, unable to find version `master`\n```\n\nThat is the entire cause of the three red checks on every recent PR —\nLinters, Generate SBOM, Generate Coverage Report. #426 was merged over\nexactly these three, and #428 currently carries the same set.\n\n`benchmarks.yml` already pointed at `@main` and stayed green throughout,\nwhich is the control that separates \"the action ref is stale\" from \"the\nrepo's checks are broken\".\n\n## Verification\n\n`gh api repos/Homebrew/actions --jq .default_branch` returns `main`, and\nthe branch listing contains only `main`. `actionlint` exits 0 on the\nedited tree. All four workflows trigger on `pull_request`, so this PR's\nown checks exercise the fixed refs.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nhttps://claude.ai/code/session_01M3uSDgzvBymKnJWgmMy8u1\n\nCo-authored-by: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>",
