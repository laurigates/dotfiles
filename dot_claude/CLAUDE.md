# CLAUDE.md - Development Guide

## Preferred Development Practices

<package-management>
**Modern Package Management**
- **Python**: Use `uv` for fast, reliable dependency management
- **Node.js**: Use `bun` for optimal package management
- **Rust**: Use `cargo` with modern practices and security audits
- **Go**: Use modules with `go mod` and version pinning
</package-management>

<testing-approach>
**Test-Driven Development**
- Follow TDD principles for robust, maintainable code
- Write tests first to guide implementation design
- Embrace the RED, GREEN, REFACTOR cycle
</testing-approach>

## MCP Server Tools

<core-tools>
**Primary Tools**
- **`context7`**: Documentation lookup for accurate implementation
- **`vectorcode`**: Semantic code analysis for better understanding
- **`github`**: Complete GitHub operations
- **`graphiti-memory`**: Long-term knowledge graph for learning and consistency
- **`zen-mcp-server`**: Structured workflows and deep analysis
- **`playwright`**: Browser automation and testing
</core-tools>

<best-practices>
**Recommended Usage Patterns**
- Start with `context7` for documentation lookup to ensure accuracy
- Use `vectorcode` for semantic code searches to get optimal results
- Use `playwright` for browser automation and testing tasks
</best-practices>

<advanced-analysis>
**Zen-MCP Tools for Complex Analysis**

**When these tools work best:**
1. **Complex Problem Analysis** - `debug`, `analyze`, `thinkdeep` for systematic investigation
2. **Security Analysis** - `secaudit` for comprehensive security assessment
3. **Code Quality Review** - `codereview` for thorough quality evaluation
4. **Architecture Planning** - `planner` for step-by-step system design
5. **Refactoring Strategy** - `refactor` for systematic code improvement
6. **Pre-commit Validation** - `precommit` for comprehensive change analysis
7. **Test Strategy** - `testgen` for systematic test planning and generation
8. **Multi-perspective Decisions** - `consensus` for collaborative validation

**Tool Selection Guide:**
- **`debug`**: Systematic issue investigation and root cause analysis
- **`thinkdeep`**: Multi-stage reasoning with evidence-based analysis
- **`analyze`**: Comprehensive codebase assessment and architectural review
- **`codereview`**: Systematic code quality and security evaluation
- **`secaudit`**: Thorough security vulnerability assessment
- **`planner`**: Breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps
- **`consensus`**: Decisions that benefit from multiple expert perspectives
- **`precommit`**: Comprehensive change validation before commits
</advanced-analysis>

<sequential-thinking>
**Sequential-Thinking MCP for Structured Reasoning**

**Ideal for:**
1. **Complex Problem Decomposition** - Break down multi-faceted issues into logical sequences
2. **Decision Making** - Walk through decision trees with clear reasoning chains
3. **Architecture Design** - Think through system design decisions step by step
4. **Debugging Complex Issues** - Systematic investigation with clear thought progression
5. **Learning New Concepts** - Process new information with structured understanding
6. **Risk Assessment** - Evaluate potential impacts through methodical analysis
</sequential-thinking>

<memory-keeper>
**Memory-Keeper for Continuous Learning**

**Capture insights after completing:**
- Complex technical problems and debugging solutions
- Architectural decisions and design choices
- Successful patterns, configurations, and approaches
- Learning experiences for future reference
- Tool configurations and optimizations
- Performance improvements and enhancements
- Build, deployment, and environment solutions
- Security implementations and configurations

**Storage Format**: Record the problem/context, solution approach, key decisions made, why it worked (or what was learned), and insights for similar future scenarios.
