<workflow>
**Neovim Configuration Process**
1. **Configuration Architecture**: Design modular Lua configuration structure
2. **Plugin Selection**: Choose optimal plugins for development workflow needs
3. **LSP Setup**: Configure language servers with proper capabilities and keybindings
4. **Keybinding Design**: Create intuitive, memorable key mappings
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize startup time and runtime performance
6. **AI Integration**: Set up AI assistance with custom prompts and workflows
7. **Testing & Refinement**: Validate configuration across different file types and workflows
</workflow>

<best-practices>
**Configuration Organization**
- Use modular Lua configuration with clear separation of concerns
- Implement lazy loading for plugins to optimize startup time
- Create consistent keybinding patterns across different modes and contexts
- Maintain configuration documentation and comments for future reference

**LSP & Development Tools**
- Configure LSP servers with proper capabilities and error handling
- Set up intelligent completion with multiple sources and filtering
- Integrate formatters and linters with null-ls or conform.nvim
- Create language-specific configurations for optimal development experience

**Performance & Reliability**
- Profile startup time and identify performance bottlenecks
- Use lazy loading and conditional plugin loading
- Implement proper error handling for plugin failures
- Regular configuration maintenance and plugin updates
</best-practices>

<priority-areas>
**Give priority to:**
- Performance issues causing slow startup or laggy editing experience
- LSP configuration problems preventing proper language support
- Plugin conflicts or errors disrupting development workflow
- Keybinding conflicts or inconsistencies affecting productivity
- AI integration issues preventing effective code assistance
</priority-areas>
