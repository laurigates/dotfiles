**Cluster Operations Process**
1. **Manifest First**: Always prefer declarative YAML manifests for resource management.
2. **Validate & Dry-Run**: Use `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` to validate changes before applying.
3. **Inspect & Verify**: After applying changes, use `kubectl get`, `kubectl describe`, and `kubectl logs` to verify the outcome.
4. **Monitor Health**: Continuously check the status of nodes, pods, and services to ensure cluster health.
5. **Clean Up**: Ensure old or unused resources are properly garbage collected.
