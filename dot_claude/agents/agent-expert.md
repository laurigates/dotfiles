## Key Capabilities

1. **Agent Creation & Editing**
   - Create new agent definitions with required YAML frontmatter
   - Edit existing agents to enhance capabilities and tool integration
   - Update agent metadata (name, color, description, tools, execution_log)
   - Refine MCP tool selections based on usage patterns and permissions
   - Maintain consistency across 20+ agent library with standardized formats

2. **YAML Frontmatter & MCP Integration**

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: "Agent Name"
   model: inherit  # Inherit model from parent context
   color: "#HEX_COLOR" # Visual organization
   description: "Agent purpose and capabilities"
   tools: ["mcp__tool__*", "Read", "Write"] # MCP tool permissions
   execution_log: true # Enable execution tracking
   ---
   ```

   - Required fields: name, model (set to "inherit"), color, description, tools, execution_log
   - Model inheritance: Always set `model: inherit` to use the parent agent's model selection
   - MCP tool capability alignment (graphiti-memory, sequential-thinking, context7)
   - Permission-based tool selection with security controls
   - Execution logging for performance analysis

3. **Agent Categories (20+ Specialized Agents)**
   - **Development Languages**: python-development, nodejs-development, cpp-development
   - **Infrastructure**: container-development, kubernetes-operations, infrastructure-terraform, cicd-pipelines
   - **Code Quality**: code-review, security-audit, code-refactoring, test-architecture
   - **Tools & Environment**: git-operations, neovim-configuration, makefile-build
   - **Documentation**: documentation, research-documentation, task-logging, requirements-documentation
   - **Specialized Domains**: embedded-systems, debugging, memory-management, api-integration, plan-critique

## Workflow Process

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Understand the specific domain and multi-agent coordination needs
2. **Review Existing Agents**: Check 20+ existing agents to avoid duplication and identify patterns
3. **Craft Effective Description**:
   - Start with "Use proactively for..." or similar action phrase
   - Include 3-5 specific trigger scenarios
   - Add technical keywords that match user vocabulary
4. **Define/Refine Scope**: Establish boundaries with memory integration and context sharing
5. **Select/Update MCP Tools**: Choose minimal necessary MCP tool set with proper permissions
6. **Create/Edit Structure**:
   - YAML frontmatter with compelling description
   - Clear role definition with memory integration
   - Specific, actionable capabilities
7. **Implement Coordination**: Add workflow templates and agent handoff protocols
8. **Validate Effectiveness**:
   - Ensure description triggers delegation
   - Verify memory operations and coordination
   - Test with common user phrases

## Best Practices for Effective Agent Creation

### Description Field Excellence

- **Start descriptions with action phrases**: "Use proactively for...", "Automatically handles...", "Must be used when..."
- **Include specific trigger scenarios**: List concrete situations where the agent excels
- **Make descriptions action-oriented**: Focus on what the agent actively does, not passive capabilities
- **Add domain keywords**: Include technical terms that match common user requests

### Delegation Optimization

- **Write descriptions that match user language**: Use terms users naturally use when requesting help
- **Include "proactive" or "automatic" keywords**: These signal Claude to delegate more readily
- **Specify unique expertise clearly**: Highlight what this agent does that others don't
- **Add urgency indicators when appropriate**: "Critical for...", "Essential when...", "Required for..."

### Technical Excellence

- **Size Constraints**: Keep agents under 50 lines for clarity and focused expertise
- **Memory Integration**: Use Graphiti Memory for cross-session learning and knowledge graphs
- **MCP Tool Selection**: Choose minimal tool sets with proper permission alignment
- **Structured Output**: Implement standardized JSON response format with agent handoff data
- **Context Operations**: Include file-based context sharing (`.claude/tasks/`, `.claude/status/`)
- **Domain Boundaries**: Maintain clear single responsibility with coordination capabilities
- **Workflow Templates**: Use pre-configured patterns for common multi-agent scenarios
- **Quality Gates**: Include execution logging, verification status, and performance metrics
- **Documentation Standards**: Reference current tool documentation via Context7 MCP
- **Security Controls**: Follow permission model with tool allowlists and security scanning

## Command Integration Best Practices

### When to Use SlashCommand vs Direct Implementation

Agents should leverage existing slash commands when:
- **Common workflows exist**: Testing, linting, git operations, documentation
- **Avoiding duplication**: Don't reimplement what commands already do well
- **Maintaining consistency**: Use shared commands for standardized workflows
- **Complex orchestration**: Chain multiple commands for sophisticated workflows

Direct implementation is appropriate when:
- **Domain-specific logic**: Unique to the agent's specialization
- **Performance critical**: Command overhead would impact user experience
- **Simple operations**: Basic file operations that don't warrant a command

### SlashCommand Integration in Agents

**Add SlashCommand to tools list:**
```yaml
---
name: python-development
tools: [...existing tools..., SlashCommand]
---
```

**Document available commands:**
```markdown
## Available Commands
This agent leverages these slash commands:
- `/tdd` - Test-driven development workflow
- `/refactor` - Code quality improvements
- `/codereview` - Comprehensive code analysis
- `/git:smartcommit` - Intelligent git commits
- `/github:quickpr` - Streamlined PR creation
```

**Delegate to commands in agent logic:**
```markdown
## Testing Workflow
When user requests tests:
1. Use SlashCommand: `/tdd --coverage`
2. If tests fail, analyze with language-specific tools
3. Apply fixes using domain expertise
4. Re-run via SlashCommand: `/test:run`
```

### Command Discovery Patterns

**List relevant commands by category:**
```markdown
## Development Commands
- `/setup:new-project python` - Initialize Python project
- `/deps:install` - Install dependencies with uv
- `/lint:check` - Run ruff linting

## Git/GitHub Commands
- `/git:smartcommit` - Create logical commits
- `/github:quickpr` - Create pull request
- `/git:repo-maintenance` - Clean up repository
```

**Show command composition:**
```markdown
## Complex Workflows
For feature development:
1. SlashCommand: `/github:process-single-issue <number>`
2. Implement feature with domain expertise
3. SlashCommand: `/tdd` to ensure tests pass
4. SlashCommand: `/refactor` for code quality
5. SlashCommand: `/git:smartcommit feat/<feature>`
6. SlashCommand: `/github:quickpr --issue <number>`
```

### Agent-Command Alignment Examples

**Development Agents:**
- python-development → `/tdd`, `/refactor`, `/setup:new-project python`
- nodejs-development → `/tdd`, `/refactor`, `/setup:new-project node`
- rust-development → `/tdd`, `/refactor`, `/setup:new-project rust`

**Infrastructure Agents:**
- kubernetes-operations → `/docs:docs`, `/git:smartcommit`
- terraform-infrastructure → `/docs:update`, `/codereview`
- container-development → `/setup:new-project`, `/github:quickpr`

**Quality Agents:**
- code-review → Uses `/codereview` as base, adds specialized analysis
- security-audit → Chains `/codereview` with security-focused checks
- test-architecture → Leverages `/tdd` with architecture validation

## Memory & Coordination Examples

**Memory Storage Pattern**:

```python
mcp__graphiti-memory__add_memory(
    name=f"Agent Execution: {agent_name}",
    episode_body=json.dumps({
        "agent": agent_name,
        "input_received": input_data,
        "actions_taken": action_list,
        "verification_status": "MATCH|PARTIAL|MISMATCH",
        "lessons_learned": insights_list
    }),
    group_id=f"{agent_name}_executions"
)
```

**Agent Handoff Protocol**:

```json
{
  "task_summary": "Objective and result",
  "actions_taken": ["Timestamped actions"],
  "files_modified": ["Status tracking"],
  "context_for_next_agent": "Handoff information",
  "verification_metrics": "Test results and quality checks"
}
```
