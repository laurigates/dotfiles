Comprehensive Plan: Fix PR Test Failures and Issues

Overview

This plan systematically addresses test failures and CI issues using proven
Zen MCP tools to achieve a completely green CI pipeline and pristine PR merge.

Current Status Assessment

First, assess the current state of the PR:
- Run test suite to identify failing tests
- Check CI pipeline status and error patterns
- Analyze code coverage if applicable
- Review any linting or build failures

Execution Strategy

Phase A: Comprehensive Analysis

Step 1: ThinkDeep Investigation
├── Analyze all test failures and CI issues
├── Focus on workflow breakpoints and error patterns
├── Identify failure patterns and common root causes
└── Use high thinking mode for complex debugging

Step 2: Documentation Research
├── Use Context7 to research relevant framework/tool requirements
├── Understand proper project structure and dependencies
├── Research best practices for the identified issues
└── Validate workflow assumptions against documentation

Phase B: Root Cause Categorization

Step 3: Failure Pattern Analysis
├── Group failures by likely causes:
│ ├── API/Dependency Issues (version compatibility, missing deps)
│ ├── Workflow/Integration Problems (pipeline breaks, process issues)
│ ├── Environment Issues (security, permissions, configuration)
│ ├── Performance/Timing Issues (timeouts, race conditions)
│ └── Logic/Implementation Problems (business logic errors)
├── Prioritize fixes by impact (common causes first)
└── Plan incremental validation strategy

Phase C: Systematic Fix Implementation

Step 4: Apply Targeted Fixes
├── Address common root causes first
├── Apply category-specific fixes:
│ ├── Dependency and compatibility updates
│ ├── Workflow and integration corrections
│ ├── Environment and configuration improvements
│ └── Performance and timing optimizations
└── Validate each fix incrementally

Step 5: Comprehensive Validation
├── Run test suite after each change
├── Ensure no regression in existing passing tests
├── Monitor any coverage or quality metrics
└── Final comprehensive validation before merge

Tools and Methods

Primary Tools

- ThinkDeep: Systematic debugging and root cause analysis
- Context7: Framework/library documentation research and validation
- GitHub MCP: CI logs and workflow status monitoring
- Incremental Testing: Prevent regression and validate fixes

Validation Approach

- Incremental: Test each fix immediately after application
- Comprehensive: Full test suite validation at completion
- Quality Monitoring: Track progress toward project quality targets
- Regression Prevention: Validate existing tests remain passing

Success Criteria

Primary Goals

- All failing tests pass consistently
- CI pipeline completely green (no failures/warnings/errors)
- No regression in existing passing tests

Secondary Goals

- Maintain or improve code quality metrics
- Tests complete within reasonable time limits
- Updated PR ready for pristine merge

Risk Mitigation

Strategies

- Incremental Validation: Prevents cascade failures
- Systematic Approach: Uses proven Zen MCP methodology
- Documentation Research: Ensures best practices and accuracy
- Rollback Plan: Ability to revert if fixes cause regression

Monitoring Points

- After each ThinkDeep analysis - assess pattern clarity
- After Context7 research - validate framework understanding
- After each fix - run incremental tests
- After all fixes - comprehensive validation

Expected Deliverables

1. All failing tests passing
2. CI checks completely green
3. Maintained or improved code quality metrics
4. Updated PR ready for pristine merge
5. Documentation of fixes applied

This plan provides a systematic approach for fixing PR issues using proven
Zen MCP tools. The structured use of ThinkDeep, Context7, and GitHub MCP tools
ensures thorough analysis and targeted fixes for achieving a pristine PR merge
regardless of the project type or technology stack.
