Comprehensive Plan: Fix Integration Test Failures for Pristine PR Merge

Overview

This plan systematically addresses the remaining 6 integration test failures
using proven Zen MCP tools to achieve a completely green CI pipeline and
pristine PR merge.

Current Status

- Tests: 185 passing, 6 failing (integration tests)
- Coverage: 30.10% (target: >80%)
- Failing Tests:
- test_pin_level_connectivity
- test_complete_project_workflow
- test_project_discovery_and_analysis
- test_error_recovery_workflow
- test_large_project_workflow
- test_concurrent_operations

Execution Strategy

Phase A: Comprehensive Analysis

Step 1: ThinkDeep Investigation
├── Analyze all 6 integration test failures
├── Focus on workflow breakpoints:
│ Project Creation → Component Addition → Netlist → Export
├── Identify failure patterns and common root causes
└── Use high thinking mode for complex debugging

Step 2: KiCad Documentation Research
├── Use Context7 to research KiCad workflow requirements
├── Understand proper project structure and dependencies
├── Research pin-level connectivity requirements
└── Validate workflow assumptions against documentation

Phase B: Root Cause Categorization

Step 3: Failure Pattern Analysis
├── Group failures by likely causes:
│ ├── API/Tool Access Issues (FastMCP 2.0 related)
│ ├── Workflow Sequence Problems (pipeline breaks)
│ ├── Resource/Environment Issues (security, permissions)
│ ├── Performance/Timing Issues (async, large projects)
│ └── Error Handling/Recovery Problems
├── Prioritize fixes by impact (common causes first)
└── Plan incremental validation strategy

Phase C: Systematic Fix Implementation

Step 4: Apply Targeted Fixes
├── Address common root causes first
├── Apply category-specific fixes:
│ ├── FastMCP 2.0 API compatibility updates
│ ├── Workflow sequence corrections
│ ├── Resource management improvements
│ └── Performance/timing optimizations
└── Validate each fix incrementally

Step 5: Comprehensive Validation
├── Run pytest on fixed tests after each change
├── Ensure no regression in existing 185 passing tests
├── Monitor coverage improvement toward 80% target
└── Final comprehensive test suite validation

Tools and Methods

Primary Tools

- ThinkDeep: Systematic debugging and root cause analysis
- Context7: KiCad documentation research and workflow validation
- GitHub MCP: CI logs and workflow status monitoring
- Incremental Testing: Prevent regression and validate fixes

Validation Approach

- Incremental: Test each fix immediately after application
- Comprehensive: Full test suite validation at completion
- Coverage Monitoring: Track progress toward 80% target
- Regression Prevention: Validate existing tests remain passing

Success Criteria

Primary Goals

- All 6 integration tests pass consistently
- CI pipeline completely green (no failures/warnings/errors)
- No regression in existing 185 passing tests

Secondary Goals

- Achieve >80% test coverage (from current 30.10%)
- Tests complete within reasonable time limits
- Updated PR ready for pristine merge

Risk Mitigation

Strategies

- Incremental Validation: Prevents cascade failures
- Systematic Approach: Uses proven Zen MCP methodology
- Documentation Research: Ensures workflow accuracy
- Rollback Plan: Ability to revert if fixes cause regression

Monitoring Points

- After each ThinkDeep analysis - assess pattern clarity
- After Context7 research - validate workflow understanding
- After each fix - run incremental tests
- After all fixes - comprehensive validation

Expected Deliverables

1. All 6 integration tests passing
2. CI checks completely green
3. Improved test coverage (>80%)
4. Updated PR ready for pristine merge
5. Documentation of fixes applied

This plan leverages the same systematic approach that successfully resolved the
unit test failures, now applied to the more complex integration test
challenges. The structured use of ThinkDeep, Context7, and GitHub MCP tools
ensures thorough analysis and targeted fixes for achieving the pristine PR
merge goal.
