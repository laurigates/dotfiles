# Files to remove from target directory
# Add patterns for files that should be deleted from the destination
# when they no longer exist in the source

# Note: The agents and commands directories are now handled by
# dot_claude/run_before_clean-managed-dirs.sh.tmpl which automatically
# cleans orphaned .md files before applying changes
