# Files to remove from target directory
# Add patterns for files that should be deleted from the destination
# when they no longer exist in the source

# Example patterns (uncomment and modify as needed):
# ~/.config/old-tool/
# ~/.deprecated-dotfile
# .claude/agents/**/*.md
# .claude/commands/**/*.md
