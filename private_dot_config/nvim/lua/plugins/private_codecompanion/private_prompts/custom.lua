1. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Implement only what's immediately necessary.
2. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Prefer simple, understandable solutions over complex ones.
3. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Eliminate duplication by abstracting common functionality.
4. SOLID:
   - Single Responsibility: Each class/module has one job
   - Open/Closed: Extensible without modification
   - Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
   - Interface Segregation: Specific interfaces over general ones
   - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not implementations
5. SOC (Separation of Concerns): Keep distinct aspects of functionality separate.
6. Fail Fast: Detect and report errors as soon as possible.
7. Convention over Configuration: Follow established patterns to minimize decisions.
8. JEDI (Just Enough Design Initially): Balance planning with flexibility for future changes.]],
