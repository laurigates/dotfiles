# Issues

## Summary

This is a dumping ground for issues with my environment I have yet to resolve.

## X11

- xdg-open tries to open smb:// links in chrome instead of a file manager

## vim

- Should add some kind of automatic cleanup of `~/.vim/temp_dirs` based of file age.
- Completions have to be selected using Ctrl+Y instead of enter now for some reason
- Cycling through completions can only be done with arrow keys?
