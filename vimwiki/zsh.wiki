## Commands

`z`
`type` is a nice zsh builtin implementation of `which` or `whence`

## History

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/243317/bash-how-can-i-replace-a-string-in-a-previous-command

`!!:2` recall the 2nd argument of the last command
`!!:gs/one/two` recall the previous command, but replace 'one' with 'two' globally
`^one^two` recall the previous command, but replace 'one' with 'two'
`^one^two^:G` recall the previous command, but replace 'one' with 'two' globally

## Globbing

`du -sh *` won't include hidden files
`du -sh *(D)` will include hidden files

Press tab after `*(` for suggestions

## Hotkeys

`Ctrl+t` list files+folders in current directory (e.g., git commit <CTRL+T>, select a few files using <TAB>, finally <Return>)

`Ctrl+r` search history of shell commands

`Alt+c` fuzzy change directory

`Ctrl+x a` expands all aliases
