# devloop.md - Development Loop Instructions for Claude

When the user types `/workflow:dev`, follow these instructions to execute an automated development loop.

## Overview

Use zen to perform a codereview using gemini pro and use planner to generate a detailed plan, implement the fixes and do a final precommit check by continuing from the previous codereview. Check GitHub issues using the GitHub MCP and consider them during planning.

Execute a continuous development cycle that:

1. Ensures clean environment setup
2. Identifies and creates issues from test failures
3. Intelligently selects issues to work on
4. Implements solutions following TDD
5. Creates pull requests and monitors CI
6. Repeats until stopped or issues resolved

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Phase 1: Environment Setup & Assessment

**1. Ensure on main branch and sync**

```bash
git switch main
git pull
```

**2. Run the project's test suite**

- Detect project type (check for `manage.py`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.)
- Run appropriate test command:
  - Django: `python manage.py test`
  - Node.js: `npm test`
  - Rust: `cargo test`
  - Python: `pytest` or `python -m pytest`
  - Go: `go test ./...`

**3. Create GitHub issues for any test failures**

- For each failing test, use `github:create_issue` with:
  - Title: `"Test failure: {test_name}"`
  - Body: Include error output, stack trace, and failure context
  - Labels: `["bug", "test-failure"]`

**4. List current repository issues**

- Use `github:list_issues` with `state=open`
- Filter out issues that are blocked or need external input

### Phase 2: Issue Selection Strategy

**Select issues using this priority order:**

1. **Critical bugs**: Issues labeled `priority: critical` or `bug` + `high priority`
2. **Test failures**: Issues just created from failing tests (highest priority)
3. **Quick wins**: Issues labeled `good first issue` or estimated < 1 hour
4. **High-impact features**: Issues with most reactions/comments
5. **Technical debt**: Oldest issues labeled `technical-debt` or `refactor`

**Selection criteria (must meet ALL):**

- Has clear acceptance criteria in description
- Not labeled `blocked` or `waiting-for-input`
- Not already assigned to someone else
- Can reasonably be completed in a single PR

**If no suitable issues found:**

- Run dependency audit (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`)
- Create issues for security vulnerabilities
- Run linting tools and create issues for violations

### Phase 3: Implementation Loop

**For the selected issue, repeat until CI passes:**

**5. Create feature branch**

```bash
git switch -c fix/issue-{number}-{brief-description}
```

**6. Gather implementation context**

- **ALWAYS use Context7 MCP** to fetch current documentation for relevant libraries/frameworks before implementation
- Use `context7:resolve-library-id` followed by `context7:get-library-docs` for any tools mentioned
- Read issue description and any linked documentation
- Review related issues and PRs for context
- **For package managers (uv, npm, bun, etc.)**: Always fetch current best practices via Context7 before suggesting commands

**7. Implement solution using TDD**

- **RED**: Write a failing test (if test doesn't already exist)
- **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
- **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
- Follow language-specific best practices from Claude Code Guidelines

**8. Commit changes**

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue #{number} - {brief description}"
```

- Use conventional commit format
- Reference issue number in commit message

**9. Push branch**

```bash
git push origin fix/issue-{number}-{brief-description}
```

**10. Create pull request**

- Use `github:create_pull_request` with:
  - Title: `"fix: resolve issue #{number} - {brief description}"`
  - Body: `"Fixes #{number}"` plus description of changes
  - Include testing notes and any breaking changes

**11. Monitor CI status**

- Use GitHub MCP to check workflow status
- Wait for all checks to start and complete

**12. Fix CI failures (if any)**

- Use `github:get_pull_request_status` to check specific failures
- Analyze workflow logs to understand failures
- Implement fixes and push additional commits
- Repeat until all checks pass

### Phase 4: Completion & Loop

**13. Verify CI success**

- Confirm all required checks are green
- Ensure no failing workflows remain

**14. Close the issue**

- Use `github:update_issue` to close with state `closed`
- Add comment referencing the closing PR

**15. Return to Phase 1**

- Go back to environment setup
- Continue the loop for the next issue

## Configuration Options

Handle these command variations:

- `/workflow:dev` - Run continuous loop until stopped
- `/workflow:dev --max-cycles 3` - Limit to 3 issue resolution cycles
- `/workflow:dev --focus bug` - Only work on issues labeled "bug"
- `/workflow:dev --quick-wins` - Only pick issues estimated < 30 minutes
- `/workflow:dev --test-only` - Only create issues for test failures; implementation handled separately
- `/workflow:dev --dry-run` - Explain what would be done without making changes

## Error Handling

**Issue too complex to complete:**

- Add comment: `"This issue requires more detailed analysis - skipping for now"`
- Add label `needs-investigation`
- Skip to next issue in priority order

**Persistent CI failures (3+ attempts):**

- Create new issue titled `"CI Pipeline Issue: {workflow_name} failing"`
- Include workflow logs and error details
- Label as `ci-infrastructure`
- Skip current issue and continue with next

**No issues available:**

- Run automated maintenance tasks:
  - Dependency updates (`npm update`, `pip install --upgrade`, etc.)
  - Security audits and create issues for vulnerabilities
  - Code quality scans (linting) and create issues for violations
- If still no work, report completion and wait for new issues

**Git/GitHub API errors:**

- Retry operations up to 3 times
- If persistent, report error and pause loop
- Suggest manual intervention steps

## Success Reporting

After each completed issue, report:

```
✅ Issue #{number} resolved successfully!

Branch: fix/issue-{number}-{description}
PR: #{pr_number} - {pr_title}
CI Status: ✅ All checks passing
Time: {duration}

Continuing to next issue...
```

## Loop Termination

Stop the loop when:

- User interrupts the process
- `--max-cycles` limit reached
- No suitable issues remain after thorough search
- Critical error requires manual intervention

Provide final summary:

```
🏁 DevLoop completed!

📊 Summary:
- Issues resolved: {count}
- PRs created: {count}
- Tests added/fixed: {count}
- Total time: {duration}

📋 Recommendations:
- Review open PRs for merge
- Consider upgrading dependencies
- Add more test coverage for uncovered code
```

## Integration Notes

**Required tools:**

- GitHub MCP for all GitHub operations
- **Context7 MCP for documentation lookup (REQUIRED before any tool usage)**
- Git command line access
- Project-specific testing tools
- Modern package managers: uv (Python), npm/bun (JavaScript), cargo (Rust)

**Repository requirements:**

- Clean git working directory (or only intended changes)
- GitHub Actions or other CI configured
- Issue templates and labels configured
- Branch protection requiring PR reviews

**Best practices:**

- Always use GitHub MCP's context toolset for repository awareness
- Follow TDD principles strictly - no production code without tests
- Keep commits small and focused
- Use conventional commit messages
- Reference issues in all commits and PRs
