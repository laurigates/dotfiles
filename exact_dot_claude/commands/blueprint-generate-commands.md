Generate workflow commands customized for this project.

**Prerequisites**:
- Project has recognizable structure (package.json, Makefile, etc.)
- PRDs exist in `.claude/blueprints/prds/`

**Steps**:

1. **Detect project type and stack**:
   - Check for `package.json` → Node.js project
   - Check for `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` → Python project
   - Check for `Cargo.toml` → Rust project
   - Check for `go.mod` → Go project
   - Check for `Makefile` → Check make targets

2. **Detect test runner and commands**:
   - Node.js: Check `package.json` scripts for `test`, `test:unit`, `test:integration`
   - Python: Check for pytest, unittest
   - Rust: `cargo test`
   - Go: `go test`

3. **Detect build and dev commands**:
   - Check `package.json` scripts
   - Check `Makefile` targets
   - Check project-specific tools

4. **Generate `/project:continue` command**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: "Analyze project state and continue development where left off"
   allowed_tools: [Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, Edit, Write]
   ---

   Continue project development:

   1. **Check current state**:
      - Run `git status` (branch, uncommitted changes)
      - Run `git log -5 --oneline` (recent commits)

   2. **Read context**:
      - All PRDs in `.claude/blueprints/prds/`
      - `work-overview.md` (current phase and progress)
      - Recent work-orders (completed and pending)

   3. **Identify next task**:
      - Based on PRD requirements
      - Based on work-overview progress
      - Based on git status (resume if in progress)

   4. **Begin work following TDD**:
      - Apply project-specific skills automatically
      - Follow RED → GREEN → REFACTOR workflow
      - Commit incrementally with conventional commits

   Report before starting:
   - Current project status summary
   - Next task identified
   - Approach and plan
   ```

5. **Generate `/project:test-loop` command**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: "Run test → fix → refactor loop with TDD workflow"
   allowed_tools: [Read, Edit, Bash]
   ---

   Run TDD cycle:

   1. **Run test suite**: `[detected_test_command]`
   2. **If tests fail**:
      - Analyze failure output
      - Identify root cause
      - Make minimal fix to pass the test
      - Re-run tests to confirm
   3. **If tests pass**:
      - Check for refactoring opportunities
      - Refactor while keeping tests green
      - Re-run tests to confirm still passing
   4. **Repeat until**:
      - All tests pass
      - No obvious refactoring needed
      - User intervention required

   Report:
   - Test results summary
   - Fixes applied
   - Refactorings performed
   - Current status (all pass / needs work / blocked)
   ```

6. **Generate project-specific commands** (optional):
   - If web app: Commands for starting dev server, running migrations
   - If CLI: Commands for building, testing CLI
   - If library: Commands for building, publishing

7. **Report**:
   ```
   ✅ Workflow commands generated!

   Created:
   - .claude/commands/project-continue.md
   - .claude/commands/project-test-loop.md
   [- Additional project-specific commands]

   Detected configuration:
   - Project type: [Node.js / Python / Rust / etc.]
   - Test command: [detected command]
   - Build command: [detected command]
   - Dev command: [detected command]

   Next steps:
   1. Use `/project:continue` to start or resume development
   2. Use `/project:test-loop` for TDD automation
   3. Use `/blueprint:work-order` to create isolated tasks

   All commands are now available via slash syntax!
   ```

**Important**:
- Detect actual project commands (don't hardcode)
- Include project-specific test commands
- Commands should be immediately usable
- Report what was detected for transparency

**Error Handling**:
- If project type unclear → Ask user for clarification
- If no test command found → Ask user how to run tests
- If commands already exist → Ask to overwrite or skip
