# /deadbranch

Survey stale git branches and clean them up safely. Always previews
before deleting; backup system means every deletion is recoverable.

## Parameters

Parse from `$ARGUMENTS` (all optional):

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--days N` | `30` | Age threshold — branches older than N days are stale |
| `--local` | off | Target local branches only |
| `--remote` | off | Target remote branches only |
| `--force` | off | Include unmerged branches (dangerous — ask for explicit confirmation) |
| `--interactive` | off | Open full-screen TUI for visual selection |
| `--dry-run` | on | Show what would be deleted without deleting (always on for the preview step) |
| `--yes` | off | Skip confirmation prompts (only use if user explicitly asks for automation) |
| `--stats-only` | off | Run stats + list only, skip the clean step entirely |

When no flags are given, default to the survey-first workflow below.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Survey

Run in parallel:

```bash
deadbranch stats
deadbranch list
```

Report both outputs. The stats command shows total branch count, stale
count, and age distribution. The list shows each stale branch with its
age, merge status, last commit date, and author.

If `--days N` was provided, pass `-d N` to both commands.
If `--local` or `--remote` was provided, pass the flag to `list`.

If no stale branches are found, stop here and report the repo is clean.
If `--stats-only` was provided, stop here after reporting.

### Step 2: Dry-run preview

Always run a dry-run before any real deletion:

```bash
deadbranch clean --dry-run [--days N] [--local|--remote] [--force]
```

Report the dry-run output. If nothing would be deleted (e.g. all stale
branches are unmerged and `--force` was not set), explain why and offer
to re-run with `--force` if the user wants to include unmerged branches.

### Step 3: Confirm and clean

After the dry-run, ask the user what to do:

```
AskUserQuestion("Proceed with branch deletion?", options=[
  "Yes — delete all shown branches",
  "Interactive TUI — let me pick",
  "No — survey only, skip deletion"
])
```

- **Yes**: run `deadbranch clean [options]`
- **Interactive**: run `deadbranch clean --interactive [options]`
  (note: the TUI requires a real terminal — warn the user that this
  opens a full-screen interface they must interact with directly via
  `! deadbranch clean --interactive`)
- **No**: print the summary and stop

If the user passed `--interactive` in `$ARGUMENTS`, skip the question
and go straight to TUI mode.
If `--yes` was explicitly passed, skip confirmation and delete directly.

### Step 4: Report

After deletion, confirm with:

```bash
deadbranch backup list
```

Report how many branches were deleted and that their SHAs are backed
up (recoverable via `deadbranch backup restore <branch>`).

## Safety Rules

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `--force` requested | Show extra warning: "This deletes unmerged branches. These are NOT recoverable from the remote." before dry-run |
| `--remote` requested | Note that remote deletion affects everyone on the team |
| Branch is WIP / draft | `deadbranch` skips these automatically; mention it in the report |
| Protected branches (main/master/develop/staging/production) | `deadbranch` skips these automatically |

## Recovery

If the user wants to recover a deleted branch:

```bash
deadbranch backup list              # see what's saved
deadbranch backup restore <branch>  # restore by name
```

Backups store the branch tip SHA. Restoration creates the branch
locally pointing at that SHA.

## Common Invocations

```bash
# Default survey + dry-run + confirm
deadbranch list
deadbranch stats
deadbranch clean --dry-run

# Local branches only, 60-day threshold
deadbranch list --local --days 60
deadbranch clean --local --days 60 --dry-run

# Remote branches — team-visible action, ask twice
deadbranch list --remote
deadbranch clean --remote --dry-run

# Interactive TUI (run by user in their terminal)
! deadbranch clean --interactive

# Non-interactive automation (CI / scripts)
deadbranch clean --yes --merged
```

## Interactive TUI Note

`deadbranch clean --interactive` opens a full-screen TUI with:
- Vim-style navigation (`hjkl`, `/` to fuzzy search)
- Visual range selection
- 6-column sort
- Space to toggle individual branches for deletion

Claude Code cannot operate the TUI — instruct the user to run it
themselves with the `!` prefix: `! deadbranch clean --interactive`.

## Configuration

`deadbranch` reads `~/.deadbranch/config.toml`. View with:

```bash
deadbranch config show
```

Key settings:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `general.default_days` | 30 | Default age threshold |
| `branches.default_branch` | auto-detect | Default branch name |
| `branches.protected` | main, master, develop, staging, production | Never deleted |
| `branches.exclude_patterns` | wip/*, draft/*, */wip, */draft | Pattern-excluded |

To change a setting:
```bash
deadbranch config set general.default_days 60
```

## Installation (if not present)

Check availability first:
```bash
which deadbranch || echo "not installed"
```

Install via cargo (preferred — already in mise/Rust toolchain):
```bash
cargo install deadbranch
```

Or via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install armgabrielyan/tap/deadbranch
```
