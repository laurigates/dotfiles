# Graphiti Learning Workflows

## Description

Workflows for learning from historical data and building institutional knowledge over time. Integrates episode storage and memory retrieval into cohesive learning patterns that improve agent performance across sessions.

## When to Use

Automatically apply this skill when:
- Starting tasks similar to previous work
- Building knowledge over time
- Analyzing trends in development work
- Creating audit trails for compliance
- Improving from past successes and failures
- Recognizing patterns across sessions

## Learning Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Before Starting Work

**Ask**: "Have I done something like this before?"

**Workflow**:
```
1. Search for similar tasks in relevant group_ids
2. Review past approaches and outcomes
3. Note lessons learned from previous work
4. Apply proven patterns
5. Avoid approaches that failed before
```

**Example**:
```python
# User asks: "Build REST API with JWT authentication"

# Step 1: Search for similar work
search_memory_facts(
    query="REST API JWT authentication implementation",
    group_ids=["python_development", "agent_executions"],
    max_facts=5
)

# Step 2: Review results
# Found: FastAPI + JWT implementation from 2 months ago
# Outcome: SUCCESS (94% test coverage, 120ms avg response)
# Lessons: "Use HTTP-only cookies", "Async context managers critical"

# Step 3: Apply insights
# - Use FastAPI (proven to work)
# - HTTP-only cookies for tokens
# - Async database connections
# - Start with pytest-asyncio fixtures

# Result: Faster implementation, fewer mistakes
```

### Stage 2: During Work

**Ask**: "Am I encountering a known problem?"

**Workflow**:
```
1. When error occurs, search error_resolutions
2. Check if similar issue solved before
3. Apply known solutions first
4. Try new approaches if no match
5. Document new resolution for future
```

**Example**:
```python
# Error encountered: "PostgreSQL connection pool exhausted"

# Step 1: Search for similar errors
search_memory_facts(
    query="PostgreSQL connection pool exhausted timeout",
    group_ids=["error_resolutions"],
    max_facts=3
)

# Step 2: Found match!
# Root cause: Pool size too small for async workload
# Solution: Increase pool_size to 20, overflow to 10
# Verification: Load test confirms fix

# Step 3: Apply immediately
# Update config, test, verify

# Result: 5-minute fix instead of hours of debugging
```

### Stage 3: After Completing Work

**Ask**: "What should I remember for next time?"

**Workflow**:
```
1. Store execution episode with approach taken
2. Document lessons learned
3. Note what worked well
4. Record challenges and how overcome
5. Update workflow patterns if improved
```

**Example**:
```python
# Just completed: FastAPI authentication implementation

# Step 1: Store episode
add_memory(
    name="Agent Execution: python-developer - FastAPI JWT Auth",
    episode_body=json.dumps({
        "task": "Implement JWT authentication for REST API",
        "approach": ["FastAPI", "PyJWT", "HTTP-only cookies"],
        "outcome": "SUCCESS",
        "lessons_learned": [
            "Async context managers essential for DB",
            "HTTP-only cookies more secure than localStorage",
            "pytest-asyncio fixtures simplify async tests"
        ],
        "time_spent": 45,
        "deliverables": ["/src/api/auth.py", "/tests/test_auth.py"]
    }),
    source="json",
    group_id="python_development"
)

# Result: Knowledge available for next similar task
```

## Learning Patterns

### Pattern 1: Incremental Learning

Build knowledge gradually from each task:

**Week 1**: First FastAPI project
- Store basic implementation patterns
- Document initial lessons

**Week 2**: Second FastAPI project
- Search for first project patterns
- Apply lessons learned
- Store new insights

**Week 3**: Third FastAPI project
- Search both previous projects
- Recognize emerging patterns
- Store refined best practices

**Result**: Each iteration improves on previous work

### Pattern 2: Error Knowledge Base

Build comprehensive error resolution knowledge:

**First Time**: Encounter error
- Debug from scratch
- Document solution
- Store in error_resolutions

**Second Time**: Similar error
- Search error_resolutions
- Apply known solution
- Update if approach improved

**Third Time**: Related error
- Search finds similar patterns
- Recognize pattern family
- Solve faster each time

**Result**: Error resolution time decreases over time

### Pattern 3: Workflow Optimization

Improve multi-agent workflows through learning:

**Initial Workflow**:
```
Research (30 min) → Development (90 min) → Testing (45 min)
Total: 165 minutes
```

**After storing and learning**:
```
Review past similar work (5 min) →
Research only unknowns (15 min) →
Development with proven patterns (60 min) →
Testing with known fixtures (30 min)
Total: 110 minutes (33% faster)
```

**Result**: Workflows optimize through historical learning

### Pattern 4: Decision Consistency

Make consistent technical decisions:

**Problem**: Different projects use different authentication approaches

**Solution**: Store decision rationales
```python
add_memory(
    name="Decision: API Authentication - JWT chosen",
    episode_body=json.dumps({
        "decision": "Use JWT with HTTP-only cookies",
        "rationale": [
            "Stateless scaling",
            "Mobile app compatibility",
            "Better security than localStorage"
        ],
        "alternatives_rejected": [
            "Session cookies - scaling challenges",
            "Basic auth - no token expiry"
        ]
    }),
    group_id="technical_decisions"
)
```

**Result**: Future projects search decisions, maintain consistency

## Integration Workflows

### Workflow 1: Agent Execution with Learning

```
1. Agent receives task
2. Search for similar past work
3. Review approaches and outcomes
4. Execute task using insights
5. Store execution results
6. Note improvements made
```

**Tools used**:
- `search_memory_facts` (before work)
- `add_memory` (after work)

### Workflow 2: Error Resolution with Learning

```
1. Error encountered
2. Search error_resolutions
3. If found: Apply solution
4. If not found: Debug and solve
5. Store resolution details
6. Make available for future
```

**Tools used**:
- `search_memory_facts` (when error occurs)
- `add_memory` (after resolution)

### Workflow 3: Multi-Agent Workflow with History

```
1. Workflow starts
2. Search for similar past workflows
3. Review agent sequence that worked
4. Apply proven coordination patterns
5. Execute workflow
6. Store workflow results with metrics
```

**Tools used**:
- `search_memory_nodes` (workflow patterns)
- `add_memory` (workflow completion)

## Metrics and Insights

Track improvement over time:

**Efficiency Metrics**:
- Time to complete similar tasks (trending down)
- Error resolution time (trending down)
- Code quality metrics (trending up)
- Test coverage (trending up)

**Knowledge Metrics**:
- Episodes stored per domain
- Successful pattern reuse count
- Error resolution knowledge base size
- Decision consistency rate

**Example tracking**:
```python
# Search for all FastAPI projects
search_memory_facts(
    query="FastAPI project implementation",
    group_ids=["python_development"],
    max_facts=20
)

# Analyze:
# - First project: 180 minutes, 85% coverage
# - Second project: 120 minutes, 90% coverage
# - Third project: 90 minutes, 94% coverage
# Insight: 50% improvement through learning
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always search before starting** - Don't reinvent solutions
2. **Store after every significant task** - Build knowledge continuously
3. **Be specific in episodes** - Generic data isn't useful
4. **Document outcomes** - Success and failure both teach
5. **Capture "why"** - Rationales help future decisions
6. **Use consistent group_ids** - Makes patterns findable
7. **Review trends** - Analyze improvement over time
8. **Update episodes** - Add "months later" insights

## Common Pitfalls

- ❌ Not searching before starting (missing available knowledge)
- ❌ Storing vague episodes (unusable for learning)
- ❌ Forgetting to store after work (lost learning opportunity)
- ❌ Inconsistent group_ids (fragmented knowledge)
- ❌ Not documenting failures (losing valuable lessons)
- ❌ Storing too much detail (noise obscures signal)
- ❌ Not reviewing past patterns (missing improvement opportunities)
