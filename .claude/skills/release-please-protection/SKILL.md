# Release-Please Protection

Automatically detects and prevents manual edits to release-please managed files across all projects.

## Overview

This skill provides proactive detection and warnings for files managed by Google's release-please automation tool. It helps prevent merge conflicts and workflow disruptions by identifying problematic edit attempts before they occur.

## When This Skill Activates

The skill automatically activates in these scenarios:

1. **Direct edit requests** to protected files
2. **User mentions** of version bumps, releases, or changelog updates
3. **Broad refactoring** that might touch version-controlled files
4. **Documentation updates** that could include CHANGELOG.md
5. **"Fix all issues"** or similar sweeping requests

## Protected Files

### Hard Protection (Permission System)
These files are **completely blocked** from editing by Claude Code's permission system:

- `**/CHANGELOG.md` - All changelog files in any location

**Operations blocked:** Edit, Write, MultiEdit
**Operations allowed:** Read (for analysis and context)

### Soft Protection (Skill Detection)
These files trigger **warnings and suggestions** before edits:

#### Package Manager Manifests (Version Fields)
- `package.json` ‚Üí `"version": "x.y.z"` (npm/Node.js)
- `pyproject.toml` ‚Üí `version = "x.y.z"` (Python/uv)
- `Cargo.toml` ‚Üí `version = "x.y.z"` (Rust/cargo)
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` ‚Üí `"version": "x.y.z"` (Claude Code plugins)
- `pom.xml` ‚Üí `<version>x.y.z</version>` (Maven/Java)
- `build.gradle` ‚Üí `version = 'x.y.z'` (Gradle)
- `pubspec.yaml` ‚Üí `version: x.y.z` (Dart/Flutter)

**Why soft protection?** Claude Code's permission system operates at the file level, not field level. Blocking entire manifest files would prevent legitimate dependency updates via automated tools (npm, cargo, uv, etc.).

## Detection Logic

Before attempting any edit, the skill checks:

### 1. File Path Analysis
```
if file_path ends with "CHANGELOG.md":
    ‚Üí Inform user of hard permission block
    ‚Üí Explain release-please workflow
    ‚Üí Suggest conventional commit approach
```

### 2. Content Pattern Matching
```
if file is package manifest AND edit touches version field:
    ‚Üí Warn about release-please management
    ‚Üí Explain why manual edits cause conflicts
    ‚Üí Offer to edit OTHER fields (but not version)
    ‚Üí Provide conventional commit template
```

### 3. Intent Recognition
```
if user request contains keywords: "version", "release", "bump", "changelog":
    ‚Üí Proactively explain release-please workflow
    ‚Üí Check if files in scope are protected
    ‚Üí Suggest proper approach before attempting edits
```

## Response Templates

### When CHANGELOG.md Edit Attempted

```
‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGELOG.md Protection Active

I cannot edit CHANGELOG.md files - they're protected by Claude Code's permission
system because they're managed by release-please automation.

**Why this matters:**
Manual edits to CHANGELOG.md cause merge conflicts with automated release PRs,
breaking your release workflow.

**Proper workflow:**
1. Make your changes with conventional commit messages:
   - feat: adds new features (minor version bump)
   - fix: bug fixes (patch version bump)
   - chore: maintenance tasks (no version bump)
   - BREAKING CHANGE: breaking changes (major version bump)

2. Release-please automatically:
   - Detects conventional commits
   - Generates CHANGELOG entries
   - Creates a release PR with version bumps
   - Tags releases when PR is merged

**Example commit:**
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 support

Implements OAuth2 authentication flow with PKCE.
Includes refresh token rotation and session management.
```

**Need to override?**
For emergency fixes, temporarily edit ~/.claude/settings.json:
1. Comment out the CHANGELOG.md deny rules
2. Make your edits
3. Re-enable protection
```

### When Version Field Edit Detected

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Version Field Protection Warning

I notice you're asking me to modify the version field in [file_name]. This field
is typically managed by release-please automation.

**Current version:** [current_version]
**Requested change:** [requested_change]

**Why manual edits are problematic:**
- Creates merge conflicts with release-please PRs
- Can cause version numbering inconsistencies
- Bypasses conventional commit history tracking

**I can help in two ways:**

1. **Automated approach (recommended):**
   I'll help you craft a conventional commit message that will trigger the
   appropriate version bump when release-please creates its next release PR.

   For [requested_change], you should use:
   - `feat:` for minor version bump
   - `fix:` for patch version bump
   - `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` for major version bump

2. **Manual override (emergency only):**
   If you absolutely need to manually set the version (e.g., aligning with
   external requirements), I can edit other fields in [file_name] but will
   skip the version field. You'll need to edit that manually or temporarily
   disable the skill protection.

Which approach would you prefer?
```

### When Broad Refactoring Requested

```
üìã Release-Please Files Detected

I've identified several release-please managed files in the scope of this
refactoring:

**Protected files found:**
- plugins/dotfiles-core/CHANGELOG.md (hard block)
- plugins/dotfiles-toolkit/.claude-plugin/plugin.json (version field)
- [other files...]

**My approach:**
‚úÖ I'll refactor all other files as requested
‚ö†Ô∏è I'll skip protected files and explain why
üìù I'll provide a summary of skipped changes

**If you need version/changelog updates:**
I'll generate appropriate conventional commit messages that will trigger
release-please to make those changes automatically.

Should I proceed with this approach?
```

## Conventional Commit Guide

The skill provides instant conventional commit templates based on the type of change:

### Feature Addition
```
feat(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of what was added and why.
Can be multiple paragraphs.

Refs: #issue-number
```

### Bug Fix
```
fix(scope): brief description

Explanation of the bug and how it was fixed.

Fixes: #issue-number
```

### Breaking Change
```
feat(scope)!: brief description

BREAKING CHANGE: Explanation of what breaks and migration path.

Details about the new behavior.

Refs: #issue-number
```

### Chore (No Version Bump)
```
chore(scope): brief description

Maintenance work that doesn't affect functionality.
Examples: dependency updates, refactoring, docs.
```

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works alongside:

- **Chezmoi Expert** - Ensures dotfiles templates don't manually edit versions
- **Git Workflow** - Enforces conventional commits before creating PRs
- **GitHub Actions** - Aware of release-please workflow configurations

## Skill Configuration

Located in `dot_claude/skills/release-please-protection/` (source) which becomes `~/.claude/skills/release-please-protection/` after chezmoi apply:

- `SKILL.md` - This file (skill definition)
- `patterns.md` - Protected file pattern reference
- `workflow.md` - Detailed release-please workflow guide

## Limitations

### What This Skill Cannot Prevent

1. **Explicit overrides** - If you explicitly instruct me to edit despite warnings
2. **Out-of-context files** - Files not in the current context window
3. **External tools** - Commands like `sed`, `awk`, or direct bash edits
4. **Git operations** - Manual `git commit` with modified protected files

### What This Skill DOES Prevent

1. **Accidental edits** - Catching mistakes before they happen
2. **Workflow violations** - Explaining proper release-please patterns
3. **Merge conflicts** - Preventing automated PR conflicts
4. **Version inconsistencies** - Maintaining semantic versioning discipline

## Emergency Overrides

If you absolutely must manually edit protected files:

### Temporary Permission Override
```bash
# 1. Edit global settings
vim ~/.claude/settings.json

# 2. Comment out deny rules
"deny": [
  "Bash(git add .)",
  "Bash(git add -A)",
  "Bash(git add --all)",
  // "Edit(**/CHANGELOG.md)",
  // "Write(**/CHANGELOG.md)",
  // "MultiEdit(**/CHANGELOG.md)"
]

# 3. Make your edits

# 4. Re-enable protection (uncomment the lines)

# 5. Verify with chezmoi
chezmoi diff ~/.claude/settings.json
chezmoi apply  # If template is out of sync
```

### Skill Bypass (Not Recommended)
```bash
# Temporarily disable skill
mv .claude/skills/release-please-protection .claude/skills/release-please-protection.disabled

# Make edits

# Re-enable
mv .claude/skills/release-please-protection.disabled .claude/skills/release-please-protection
```

## Success Metrics

This skill is working properly when:

‚úÖ All CHANGELOG.md edit attempts are blocked with helpful explanations
‚úÖ Version field modifications trigger warnings and alternatives
‚úÖ Conventional commit suggestions match the requested changes
‚úÖ Users understand the release-please workflow after first warning
‚úÖ No merge conflicts occur with automated release PRs
‚úÖ Version numbers follow semantic versioning consistently
