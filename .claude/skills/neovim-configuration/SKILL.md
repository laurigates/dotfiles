## Configuration Workflow

**Neovim Configuration Process**
1. **Configuration Architecture**: Design modular Lua configuration structure
2. **Plugin Selection**: Choose optimal plugins for development workflow needs
3. **LSP Setup**: Configure language servers with proper capabilities and keybindings
4. **Keybinding Design**: Create intuitive, memorable key mappings
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize startup time and runtime performance
6. **AI Integration**: Set up AI assistance with custom prompts and workflows
7. **Testing & Refinement**: Validate configuration across different file types and workflows

## Best Practices

**Configuration Organization**
- Use modular Lua configuration with clear separation of concerns
- Implement lazy loading for plugins to optimize startup time
- Create consistent keybinding patterns across different modes and contexts
- Maintain configuration documentation and comments for future reference

**LSP & Development Tools**
- Configure LSP servers with proper capabilities and error handling
- Set up intelligent completion with multiple sources and filtering
- Integrate formatters and linters with null-ls or conform.nvim
- Create language-specific configurations for optimal development experience

**Performance & Reliability**
- Profile startup time and identify performance bottlenecks
- Use lazy loading and conditional plugin loading
- Implement proper error handling for plugin failures
- Regular configuration maintenance and plugin updates

## Priority Areas

**Give priority to:**
- Performance issues causing slow startup or laggy editing experience
- LSP configuration problems preventing proper language support
- Plugin conflicts or errors disrupting development workflow
- Keybinding conflicts or inconsistencies affecting productivity
- AI integration issues preventing effective code assistance

## Common Configuration Patterns

**Lazy.nvim Plugin Setup**
```lua
return {
  "plugin/name",
  lazy = true,
  event = "VeryLazy",
  dependencies = { "dependency/plugin" },
  config = function()
    require("plugin").setup({
      -- configuration
    })
  end,
  keys = {
    { "<leader>k", "<cmd>Command<cr>", desc = "Description" }
  }
}
```

**LSP Configuration**
```lua
local lspconfig = require("lspconfig")
lspconfig.lua_ls.setup({
  on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
    -- Keybindings and capabilities
  end,
  settings = {
    Lua = {
      diagnostics = { globals = { "vim" } }
    }
  }
})
```

**Keybinding Pattern**
```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>f", function()
  -- Function implementation
end, { desc = "Description", silent = true })
```

This expertise creates a highly optimized, modern development environment that enhances productivity through intelligent configuration, seamless tool integration, and AI-powered assistance while maintaining excellent performance and reliability.
